 \section{\ipc Actors}
 \label{sec:components}

This section describes the state and functions of the two \ipc actors: the \gw and the \sa.

\subsection{\gwFull (\gw)}
\label{sec:gw}

The \gw is an actor that exists in every subnet in the \ipc hierarchy and contains all information and logic the subnet itself needs to hold in order to be part of \ipc.
The functionality of the \gw described in \Cref{sec:functionality} is summarized in \Cref{alg:gw}.
The \gw holds:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The names of its own, its parent's and its children's subnets

    \item The predicate used to evaluate the validity of \pofsFull.
    This predicate will be applied to {\pof}s from both the parent subnet and the child subnets.
    It is specific to the subnets (and the protocols they use) involved in interactions with this subnet.

    \item The \postoffice storing all the outgoing cross-net transactions, along with their routing metadata (original source and ultimate destination subnets).
    We model the \postoffice as an infinitely growing set, from which the appropriate \ipc agents select only those elements that need to be submitted to other subnets.
    A garbage-collection mechanism for deleting delivered outgoing cross-net transactions from the sender subnet's state is out of the scope of this document.
    One can imagine, however, a garbage-collection mechanism based on acknowledgments (that are themselves cross-net transactions).

    \item In a PoS-based subnet whose membership is managed by its parent, the \gw also contains the target membership that the subnet must reconfigure to (if the subnet is not using it yet).
    This membership is the subnet's local copy of the membership stored in its corresponding \saFull in the parent.
    It must be part of the subnet's replicated state, so that its replicas have a consistent view of it and can correctly reconfigure.
    Since reconfiguration does not happen immediately, the actual membership (also part of the subnet's replicated state) lags behind the target membership.

\end{itemize}

For example, state (lightning, payment) channels should be a specific case of subnets in which the set of validators = all clients of the subnet. In state channels, validators are required to sign in order to change the state (full safety but no liveness if $f\geq 1$) -- except for killing the subnet, allowing correct validators to withdraw with latest checkpoint without deadlocking their state in the corrupted subnet. This can be done with timelocks in an orderly manner. AFAIK Plasma chains even have the same functionality for clients to be able to circumvent a corrupted child subnet they belong to and skip to parent. }

\subsection{\saFull (\sa)}
\label{sec:sa}

The \saFull (\sa) is the actor in the parent subnet's replicated state that governs a single child subnet.
It stores all information about the child subnet that the parent needs and logic that manipulates it.
The \sa is registered in the IPC hierarchy by invoking the parent's \gw.\funcName{CreateChild}(\funcParam{subnetName}) function (see \Cref{sec:create}).
The functionality of the \sa described in \Cref{sec:functionality} is summarized in \Cref{alg:sa}.
The \sa holds:
\begin{itemize}
    
    \item The predicate (\var{valid}) used to evaluate the validity of \pofsFull of the child subnet's replicated state.
    It is specific to the child subnet and the protocol it uses, and its definition is part of \funcParam{params} passed to \gw.\funcName{CreateChild} when the \sa is created.

    \item The amount of funds that are locked for use in the child subnet (\var{lockedFunds}).
    Deposits increase and withdrawals decrease this value accordingly.
    Keeping track of this value is only necessary for enforcing the firewall property, since a misbehaving child subnet might claim to withdraw more than has been deposited in it.
    Thus, before withdrawing, the \sa consults this value to make sure that the total amount of withdrawals never exceeds the amount previously deposited.

    \item Snapshots of the child subnet's replicated state obtained through invocations of the \funcName{Checkpoint} function (\var{checkpoints}).

    \item If the child subnet is a PoS-based one, the \sa also contains state required for managing the subnet's membership and the associated collaterals.
    The high-level implementation presented in \Cref{alg:sa} presents a simplified view of this state and the associated logic, as it conveys the mechanisms involved without getting lost in details.
    In particular, the presented description neglects some corner cases arising from concurrent handling of multiple staking, releasing, and/or slashing procedures.
    In a real-world implementation, however, these corner cases can easily be addressed.

    The \sa stores information on which child replica has how much collateral (\var{childMembership}),
    how much collateral (and for which replica) is staked from which account (\var{collateral}),
    and which accounts requested the withdrawal of how much collateral (\var{collateralRequests}).
    Moreover, the \sa's state contains a predicate for checking the validity of proofs of misbehavior (\var{validPom})
    and a procedure to execute when a valid PoM is received through the \funcName{Slash} function.
