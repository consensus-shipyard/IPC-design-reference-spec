\begin{itemize}
    \item Blockchain = Net; sub-net; parent-net; root-net.
    \item nodes\arp{or validators?} --- the main participants in a blockchain system. All security guarantees of a blockchain is based on them. The verifiers of the consensus in the blockchain. 
    \item Users --- users are the clients of the system. They represent the ``real world'' entities that own coins and wish to use the system for interactions. Note: a node in the system is owned by a user (which receives the revenue), but a user does not have to own a node in order to use the system.
    %They interact with the different sub-nets through \emph{accounts}. A user that wishes to operate in sub-net $\SN$ needs to own an account in~$\SN$. For simplicity we assume a user controls at most one account in each sub-net. This generalizes to multiple accounts trivially.
    \item accounts --- an account exists in a specific sub-net. A user that wishes to operate in sub-net $\SN$ needs to own an account in~$\SN$. The account is controlled by the user.
    While users are abstract entities that are used to analyse the protocol, accounts are entities that exist in the system, hold balances, interact at the protocol level and create operations for miners to include in the sub-net.
    For simplicity we assume a user controls at most one account in each sub-net. (This generalizes to multiple accounts trivially.)
