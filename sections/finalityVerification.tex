\section{Verifying the Finality of \tx}
A main ingredient in any \nameFull implementation is the creation and verification of a finality proof for a given \tx in some subnet. In the previous sections we left these functions opaque. For example, \sa.\verifyGfinal{\tx}{\prf} was used by the parent replica to verify the finality at the child subnet of \tx. The creation of \prf and the verification method at the child replica (for transactions of that occur at the parent subnet), are only hinted by plain text. There are multiple ways to implement these functionalities, each with its own trade-offs. Below we propose several such implementations.
