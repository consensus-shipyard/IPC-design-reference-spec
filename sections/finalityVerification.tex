\section{Verifying the Finality of \tx{tx}}
\arp{I think this section should contain much more than this (but that perhaps this section does not follow our timelines for document completion (more of a complement of the document). Particular content here imo: Analysis for improvements wrt reference implementations (i.e. threshold signatures instead of everyone submitting checkpoints, governance account instead of no incentives, etc.); and Comprehensive list of different approaches for functionality/functions (like we had in the legacy document).}\guy{Agreed}
\label{sec:finality}
A main ingredient in any \ipcFull implementation is the creation and verification of a finality proof for a given \tx{tx} in some subnet. In the previous sections we left these functions opaque. For example, \sa.\verifyGfinal{\tx{tx}}{\prf} was used by the parent replica to verify the finality at the child subnet of \tx{tx}. The creation of \prf and the verification method at the child replica (for transactions of that occur at the parent subnet), are only hinted by plain text. There are multiple ways to implement these functionalities, each with its own trade-offs. Below we propose several such implementations.
