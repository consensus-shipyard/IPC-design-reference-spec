\section{Conclusion}
The scalability challenge posed by the need of consensus in blockchain
networks has led to the exploration of L2 and subsequent layers. While there has been an
explosion of L2 solutions in recent years, most of these lack of a non-monolithic design that allows for
native communication across state partitions, on-demand horizontal
scaling, decentralization, and recursive security anchoring with the
root layer. We presented in this document Interplanetary Consensus (IPC), a blockchain architecture based on web-scale on-demand horizontal
scalability through a hierarchical subnet structure. IPC leverages the
security of parent subnets to benefit child subnets and allows subnets
to be used in different ways, such as hosting different applications
or sharding a single application, or even user-motivated state partitions that are not necessarily immediate at the time of writing. As a result, we believe IPC represents a significant step
forward in the quest for L2+ scaling, providing for a sensible, flexible design that balances decentralization,
scalability, security, and usability at relatively short timescales.
