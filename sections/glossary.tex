\newglossaryentry{state}{
    name={Replicated state},
    text={state},
    description={
        Part of a replica’s local state that is guaranteed to evolve consistently across all the replicas’ local states. I.e., it is the data that each correct replica has a copy of and that each replica updates by deterministically applying a sequence of (blocks of) transactions. The replicated state is uniquely defined by the initial state (pre-defined / “hard-coded” in each replica) and a sequence of (blocks of) transactions applied to it.
        Note that replicas do not necessarily hold the same replicated state at any instant of real time, since each replica might be processing transactions at a different time. In this context, there is no such thing as “the current replicated state of the Subnet”. There is only the current replicated state of a replica. The replicated state of the system is only an abstract, logical construct useful for reasoning about transitions from one replicated state to another, happening (at different real times) at individual replicas. When referring to the replicated state of a Subnet as a whole, we mean the replicated state resulting from the application of a certain number of transactions to the initial state at any correct replica.
